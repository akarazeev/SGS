The EA, incorporated by reference in this document, is available at http://www.aphis.usda.gov/plant_health/ea/downloads/lbam-ea- Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service Emergency and Domestic Programs Emergency Management 4700 River Road, Unit 134 The revised EA analyzed alternatives consisting of (1) maintaining the Federal quarantine order without further action by APHIS (no action alternative), and (2) continuation of the Federal quarantine order along with eradication of isolated populations of LBAM in California with the use of Bacillus thuringiensis kurstaki (Btk) and/or LBAM-specific pheromone (treatment alternative). The revised EA evaluated the potential impacts from eradication treatments of small, isolated populations and determined that any potential impacts would be limited. Since the circumstances surrounding each isolated population are unique, each site will be considered in a finding of no significant impact (FONSI) prior to treatment. This FONSI addresses the treatment for LBAM in four separate sites within Moraga, Contra Costa County, California (see attachment 1). Treatment in Moraga Eradication Area Four male LBAM were found in this area (see attachment 1). Two male moths were found in the residential area near Moraga Common Park. One male moth was found in a rural area to the east of these two finds. The last moth was found north of the other sites in a residential area near Lafayette Community Park. The treatment areas will be treated with pheromone-impregnated twist ties which will be attached to trees, shrubs, and other fixtures within the area at a rate of 250 dispensers per acre. When treatments are completed, all dispensers will be removed. The revised EA evaluated the potential impacts of eradication treatments of small, isolated populations like the ones in Moraga.

      "Name: title, dtype: object, 'summary': \"Eradication of Isolated Populations of Light Brown Apple Moth in California The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), has prepared a revised environmental assessment (EA) that analyzes potential environmental consequences of eradicating isolated populations of light brown apple moth (Epiphyas postvittana) (LBAM) in California. Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service 4700 River Road, Unit 134 The revised EA analyzed alternatives consisting of (1) maintaining the Federal quarantine order without further action by APHIS (no action alternative), and (2) continuation of the Federal quarantine order along with eradication of isolated populations of LBAM in California with the use of Bacillus thuringiensis kurstaki (Btk) and/or LBAM-specific pheromone (treatment alternative). The revised EA evaluated the potential impacts from eradication treatments of small, isolated populations and determined that any potential impacts would be limited. Since the circumstances surrounding each isolated population are unique, each site will be considered in a finding of no significant impact (FONSI) prior to treatment. This FONSI addresses the potential treatment area for LBAM near San Jose in Santa Clara County, California including Cupertino and Sunnyvale, California (see attachment A). Treatment in the San Jose Eradication Area The potential treatment area has been defined to include seven different male LBAM finds just south of San Jose, California. These finds are located near Sunnyvale and Cupertino, California. San Jose is the third-largest city in California. It is located in the Santa Clara Valley at the southern end of San Francisco Bay Area. Once a small farming city, San Jose became a magnet for suburban newcomers in the new housing developments between the 1960’s and the 1990’s. Cupertino is located at the southern end of the San Francisco Bay area. The majority of the city in the Santa Clara Valley. It is headquarters to several high-tech companies such as Maxim Integrated Products, Juniper Networks, Palm, Inc., AMD, NetApp, Spansion, Yahoo!, Mirapoint, and Ariba, Inc. The city is bordered by the San Francisco Bay and San Jose to the north, Moffett Federal Airfield to the northwest, Mountain View to the west, Los Altos to the southwest, Cupertino to the south, and Santa Clara to the east. It lies along the historic El Camino Real and Highway 101. Within the potential treatment area there are seven individual treatment sites (see Attachment A). Each treatment site has been defined by drawing a 200 meter radius around each individual find. Additional finds, if any, within the potential treatment area will also be covered under this FONSI. The potential treatment area is located on the first page of the attachment. Maps of additional future finds will be made available on APHIS’ website at http://www.aphis.usda.gov/plant_health/ea/lbam.shtml. The two finds located in the southwest of the potential treatment area map have already been analyzed separately under the Cupertino FONSI and therefore the maps are not included in the attachment. All treatment sites, including any future sites, within the potential treatment area will be treated with pheromone-impregnated twist ties which will be attached to trees, shrubs, and other fixtures within the area at a rate of 250 dispensers per acre. The dispensers will be removed at the end of their useful lives. When treatments are completed, all dispensers will be removed. The revised EA evaluated the potential impacts of eradication treatments of small, isolated populations like the ones in San Jose. Due to the nature of the dispenser and the pheromone itself, there will be no impacts to the human environment including nontarget species because the product is contained in dispensers that are tied to fixtures and will be removed after treatment. In addition, there will be no negative cumulative effects from this action in combination with any other actions because there are no impacts to the human environment including nontarget species. The most likely impact will be the reduction of the LBAM population due to disruption of mating; eventually leading to the eradication of LBAM within the eradication area, and ultimately, within the State of California. A no effect determination for listed species and critical habitat has been prepared because the pheromones will not affect species other than the LBAM, and the dispensers will be tied to trees and other fixtures that will remain in the treatment sites until removal after 3 months. There are no disproportionate adverse effects to minorities, low-income populations, or children in accordance with Executive Order 12898, “Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-income Populations,” and Executive Order 13045, “Protection of Children from Environmental Health Risks and Safety Risks.” Eradication Areas for Light Brown Apple Moth Sunnyvale, Santa Clara Co, California - Spring, 2008 Blue Sage Real Twist-ties_FRANCIS_SUNNYVALE_08_SClaraCo Twist- ties_Fisherhawk_sunnyvale_08_SClaraCo CDFA - 200M LBAM ground treatment Eradication Areas for Light Brown Apple Moth Cupertino, Santa Clara County, California - 2008 Valco Pkwy De Soto Ave Magellan Ave co Pkwy Sorenson Ave Cozette uLn tna aT Tilson Ave Crabtree Ave Barnhart Ave LBAM thru 4-24-08 LBAM_200M_MURIEL_CUPERTINO_08_SClara Ave CDFA - finds, treatment boundary Rio Vista Vista s Rio Rockdale Blanco Eradication Areas for Light Brown Apple Moth San Jose, Santa Clara Co, California - 2008 Cozette a La Cresta Cielo Vista t Rio Rita Blanco Rockdale Blue Ri LBAM collected thru 4-9-08 LBAM_200M_CVIEW_SJOSE_08_NAD83_region Twist-ties_SHADY_SJOSE_08_SClaraCo The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service State Plant Health Director's Office CDFA - twist-tie treatment areas collected the data displayed for internal agency purposes only. LBAM Twist Tie Applications The following comments have been received regarding the placement of light brown apple moth (LBAM) twist ties. Several comments that were received were outside the scope of the twist tie application and have been added to general comments on the LBAM program which will be addressed under the programmatic LBAM response to comments. Comment 1: The notice of availability of the FONSI was flawed. The EA and FONSI are located on the APHIS website and the FONSI indicated when the comment period ended. Additionally, flyers that were sent to area residents about the twist tie application also referenced the availability of the FONSI and invited comments. In addition, a public meeting was held for residents in which the EA and FONSI were made available. Comment 2: What does the twist tie look like? How are LBAM and twist ties monitored? The twist ties are applied in areas where there have been few LBAM adults detected using traps. The pheromone twist ties are applied in trees at 250 twist ties per acre within a 200 meter radius around each male moth find. Twist ties may remain in an isolated area for up to 6 months if needed. Once the treatment has concluded, the twist ties will be removed and sticky traps will be used to monitor for the presence of LBAM. If additional LBAM are found within the potential treatment area there may be additional twist tie treatment sites of 200 meters surrounding the new finds. If, within a short time period (equivalent to an LBAM lifecycle) there are multiple LBAM finds within the area may no longer be considered an isolated population and other eradication methods treatments may be used. Any resident that has experienced problems with the twist ties should contact CDFA. To date, we have not received any complaints from citizens with regards to the use of LBAM twist ties. How do the twist ties mimic female moths? Female LBAM moths will emit the LBAM pheromone when they are ready to mate. Males will be attracted to the scent and will locate the female. This scent is specific to attract only LBAM. The twist ties emit high quantities of synthetically produced female LBAM pheromone. The male moths become disoriented because they cannot clearly identify the source of the pheromone. Even if females are present, males are likely to be unable to locate them due to the ubiquitous presence of female pheromone. The twist ties are not designed to attract the male LBAM. They are designed only to confuse the male LBAM so that he cannot find a mate. Are other organisms attracted to the twist ties? The twist tie emits a specific pheromone that attracts light brown apple moths. Other animals are not attracted to the pheromone. The pheromone used in the twist ties is the same pheromone that has been used in the delimiting sticky traps. Although some other insects and moths have been found in the sticky traps there is no indication that species of moths or other insects, besides light brown apple moth are attracted to the lure. Likewise, there is no evidence that the twist tie or any fixtures on the twist tie attracts birds, cats, or any other organism. Dispensers that have been placed in trees have remained in place until they have been collected after their treatment has been concluded. This indicates that no animals or people, including adults and children, have tried to remove the twist ties. What makes LBAM pheromone specific compared to OLR-F which is a pheromone for tortricids? A male moth detects pheromones through sensors much like a human can detect smells in the air. The LBAM specific pheromone is formed by adding a second compound in a specific ratio. If the ratio is not right, LBAM are less attracted to it. Other tortricids are not attracted to the LBAM specific pheromone and therefore will not be attracted to the lure. The LBAM specific pheromone will be used. What are the inerts for LBAM twist ties? The Isomate-LBAM twist tie contains 33.3% inert ingredients. This includes the ingredients for the twist tie itself, which is the dispenser that allows for the pheromone to be dispersed over time. What are the long-term human effects of LBAM pheromones? There are no known or anticipated impacts to human health associated with the LBAM specific pheromones. Prior to regulation by EPA, Isomate-LBAM was not required to have chronic toxicity data because adverse human effects were not expected based on studies conducted for the product which were submitted and reviewed by EPA. Straight chain lepidopteran pheromones, a class that Isomate-LBAM is a member of, have been used extensively over the years with no reportable side effects. Only one long term study has been conducted on this type of pheromone with no noticeable effects. The MSDS sheet states that Isomate-LBAM should not be applied to water or areas where surface water is present. The Isomate-LBAM twist ties will be hung in trees with the use of a hanger or other type of fixture that ensures that the twist tie will remain in place. In addition, LBAM pheromone is contained within a waxy tube which is insoluble in water. Although it was seen as an eye irritant that cleared within 72 hours in rabbits, the exposure levels needed to produce irritation were higher than what would be contained within the tube. It also had a slight to moderate skin irritation to rabbits at higher concentrations than would be contained within one of the tubes. The MSDS sheet specifies that if humans have been overexposed, Isomate-LBAM can be harmful if absorbed through skin and causes moderate eye irritation. This MSDS sheet is designed to provide information for workers who regularly handle the raw material of the synthetic pheromone. The pheromone twist ties come pre-filled and are encased in the waxy tube. The concentration required to be harmful if absorbed by skin greatly exceeds the amount of product contained in one twist tie. The Precautionary Statements on EPA labels are based on chemical testing done at levels much higher than those to which the general public would be exposed. The EPA safety language is directed primarily towards workers who will be handling boxes or hundreds of twist-ties over the course of the work day. The amount of pheromone contained in each twist-tie is very small - only about 0.007 fl. ounces or 188 mg and most of it is embedded within the twist-tie so workers who apply the twist ties will only be exposed to minimal amounts. The US Environmental Protection Agency has approved the use of twist-ties. The Isomate-LBAM Twist Ties do not require any special precautions when applying the twist ties to trees or other objects. Although the MSDS sheet specifies under the Over Exposure Control section that Isomate-LBAM is harmful if absorbed, this statement applies to factory workers who may handle higher quantities of Isomate-LBAM. The workers who hang the twist ties are handling pre-filled dispensers and will not be directly exposed to the synthetic pheromone. How long do the twist ties last? The twist ties may last for up to 6 months, however, in practice the twist ties are removed from each location between 3 to 6 months after placement. Individuals should report any adverse health effects that they suspect are related to the LBAM twist ties to their family physician. Any other concerns regarding the LBAM twist ties should be directed to California Department of Food and Agriculture at 1-800-491-1899. Will individuals have a choice of whether or not to allow LBAM twist ties on their property? CDFA seeks permission before entering and dispensing pheromone twist ties onto private property. Individuals who do not want pheromone twist ties placed on their property will not be required to do so. There was concern that the data within the Environmental Assessment was irrelevant and statements were not referenced. Upon review of the environmental assessment, APHIS is assured that statements have been referenced properly and that the references used were relevant to the twist tie program. If someone has specific concerns about certain statements within the EA they should notify Environmental Services in APHIS at 301.734.3823.\", 'sentiment': 0.356863, 'keywords': [('potential treatment area', 0.903355), ('light brown apple', 0.729476), ('brown apple moth', 0.729461), ('San Jose', 0.639387), ('Health Inspection Service', 0.634831), ('Santa Clara', 0.62924), ('San Francisco Bay', 0.624586), ('francisco bay area', 0.548819), ('Plant Health Inspection', 0.545772), ('isolated populations', 0.541937), ('Santa Clara Valley', 0.539805), ('Apple Moth Sunnyvale', 0.535897), ('Federal quarantine order', 0.53229), ('Jose Eradication Area', 0.531194), ('treatment area map', 0.501121), ('U.S. Department', 0.483945), ('treatment sites', 0.482114), ('potential impacts', 0.476437), ('individual treatment sites', 0.475833), ('eradication treatments', 0.466508), ('potential environmental consequences', 0.46361), ('Eradication Areas', 0.463369), ('area wide map', 0.46175), ('Santa Clara County', 0.458294), ('revised environmental assessment', 0.452778), ('LBAM ground treatment', 0.45257), ('different male LBAM', 0.45017), ('Environmental Health Risks', 0.441736), ('additional future finds', 0.435279), ('small farming city', 0.43297), ('Moffett Federal Airfield', 0.432904), ('low-income populations', 0.432279), ('Address Environmental Justice', 0.432133), ('Bacillus thuringiensis kurstaki', 0.430959), ('high tech businesses', 0.429912), ('high tech firms', 0.429403), ('new housing developments', 0.428513), ('State Plant Health', 0.428074), ('United States', 0.426635), ('El Camino Real', 0.426211), ('Maxim Integrated Products', 0.425479), ('disproportionate adverse effects', 0.424953), ('southern end', 0.424741), ('significant impact', 0.422413), ('human environment', 0.421773), ('nontarget species', 0.421632), ('negative cumulative effects', 0.419759), ('pheromone-impregnated twist ties', 0.419607), ('Silicon Valley', 0.419324), ('Executive Order', 0.418759)], 'categories': [('/business and industrial/agriculture and forestry/agriculture', 0.63675), ('/health and fitness', 0.440298), ('/art and entertainment/music/music genres/opera', 0.420173)], 'locations': [('California', 0.79731), ('San Jose', 0.692231), ('Sunnyvale', 0.641684), ('Cupertino', 0.597572), ('LBAM', 0.569738), ('Santa Clara', 0.524504), ('Santa Clara Co', 0.512589), ('United States', 0.511586), ('Santa Clara County', 0.511461), ('Santa', 0.476654), ('MD', 0.451545), ('El Camino', 0.449693), ('Riverdale', 0.440142), ('Los Altos', 0.434217), ('Mountain View', 0.427199), ('Cali', 0.418498), ('Wingate', 0.398971), ('Cheshire', 0.389651), ('Sacramento', 0.384257)]}, {'id': '3725f3dc-78fd-4231-8d80-b5c146592e7f', 'relevance': 12.445726442366716, 'type': 23917    Guidance\n",

B2-178/88), 1. Calls on the Commission, in close collaboration with the Council of Europe, to draw up and submit as soon as possible a formal proposal for the establishment of a European Foundation for East European Studies, on the basis of the abovementioned draft charter, this proposal should include the issues left unresolved in the draft charter, — having regard to the communication by the Commission on the creation of a European financial area (COM(87) 550 final — Doc. C2-310/87), 6. Approves therefore in principle of the Commission's programme for completing, by adding the final phase, the opening up of the capital markets in the Community in the light of the 8. Considers that the opening up of the capital market must benefit the citizens of the Community and Community undertakings seeking to invest and must therefore be regarded as a growth factor and as favouring Europe's economic and social cohesion; 9. Considers it essential for the Community, which does not currently occupy the place on the world financial market appropriate to its economic and commercial significance, should become a financial centre of world importance, the bedrock of an area of monetary stability centred on the ECU; Notes, however, that the creation of a genuine European financial area requires, in parallel with the liberalization of capital movements, the fulfilment of a number of other favourable and essential conditions in the banking, fiscal and monetary fields; . Insists, therefore, on the speedy implementation of the measures envisaged by the Com\\xadmission in its White Paper on the completion of the internal market, in order to remove the obstacles to the freedom of establishment and the free provision of services by financial agents, to achieve harmonization of prudential rules and to ensure equivalent levels of information and protection for investors; Insists likewise, in the present state of development of the financial markets, on the importance of introducing monitoring and prudential verification at Community level in order to safeguard the quality and credibility of the European financial area, over which the Community can maintain complete control; Stresses the importance of approximating fiscal laws regarding corporation tax, the taxa\\xadtion of collective investment undertakings for transferable securities (CIUTS) and savings incen\\xadtives in the Community, without which funds would be unevenly allocated and the benefits of integration undermined; therefore expects the Commission to take rapid steps to submit propo\\xadsals in these fields; Stresses also that in the present state of fiscal and banking legislation, the liberalization of capital movements in the Community may increase the risk of tax evasion and thus of illegal derealization of in vestments, to the detriment of the less economically developed Member States and, in short, of the economic interests of the Community; Calls therefore on the Commission to submit as soon as possible the necessary proposals for reducing the risk of tax evasion by generalized application of a withholding tax on interest from bonds and bank deposits; also calls on the Commission, in order to prevent the risk of a flight of capital to countries outside the Community, to seek at international level, in particular within the OEDC and the Council of Europe, the conclusion of agreements on the harmonization of fiscal systems and reciprocal administrative assistance to combat tax evasion; Stresses that effective management of the European financial area in the economic and social interests of the Community is inconceivable without a reaffirmation of the objectives and a significant strengthening of the scope of the EMS; at this stage, there is a close link between the monetary and the financial; Stresses likewise that until all the Member States accept that exchange rate discipline is an essential element of their economic policies and of European policy, the financial area will not bring the benefits which may be expected of it; oil the contrary, the present imbalances in the EMS are likely to be exacerbated by the complete liberalization of all capital movements; Stresses, finally, that the measures contained in the Commission's proposal on the financial area for the regulation of international currency flows and the specific safeguard clause are not adequate to deal with the financial and monetary difficulties which may lie in store for the Community; Stresses, therefore, the risks of accentuation of the economic divergences within the EEC, the possible segmentation of the Community and an increase in monetary disequilibria which are attached to any move to liberalize capital movements alone, since the effects of such a move could be very damaging, particularly for the less developed countries; Considers, therefore, that the implementation of the directive on the liberalization of capital movements must be accompanied by a whole range of measures provided for by the Commission to meet the requirements for the creation of a genuine European financial area in the banking, fiscal and currency fields. Considers that, as was requested in its resolution of 22 October 1986'on the first phase of the liberalization of capital movements (') Parliament must be kept regularly informed of devel\\xadopments and progress arising from the entry into effect of the directive implementing in full Article 67 of the EEC Treaty; Instructs its President to forward this resolution and the report by its committee to the Council and the Commission of the European Communities. Whereas Article 8a of the Treaty stipulates that the inter\\xadnal market shall comprise an area without internal fron\\xadtiers in which the free movement of capital is ensured; Whereas Article 8a of the Treaty stipulates that the inter\\xadnal market shall comprise an area without internal fron\\xadtiers in which the free movement of capital and the absence of discrimination on account of the place of resi\\xaddence of economic agents of the Member States for trans\\xadactions are ensured; 1. Withoui prejudice to the following provisions, Member States shall abolish restrictions on, and discrim\\xadination in regard to, the movement of capital taking place between persons resident in Member States, and take simultaneous steps in the other complementary areas of financial integration. The provisions of this Directive shall not prejudice the right of Member States to adopt fiscal regulations and take the requisite precautionary measures in regard to credit houses and financial intermediaries so as to prevent infringements of their laws and regulations or to lay down procedures for the declaration of capital movements for purposes of administrative, statistical or fiscal informa\\xadtion. They shall also make known by the date of their entry into force at the latest, any new measure or any amendment made to the provisions governing the capital movements listed in Annex I to this Directive. 1. The Member States shall take the measures necessa\\xadry for them to comply with this Directive no later than 12 months after its adoption. The Council Directive of 11 May 1960, as last amended by Council Directive 86/566/EEC of 17 November 1986, shall be repealed for each Member State as and when it incorporates into its national legislation the necessary measures for applying this directive. By 31 December 1988 at the latest, the Commission shall submit proposals to the Council and Parliament cover\\xading: embodying the opinion of the European Parliament on the proposal from the Commission of the European Communities to the Council on a directive for the implementation of Article 67 of the 2. After consulting the Commission, each Member State shall, where necessary, and taking account of the interests of the other Member States, apply such of the instruments mentioned in Article 2 as it deems fit. Without prejudice to these provisions, the Commis\\xadsion may recommend to the Member States that all or some instruments mentioned in Article 2 be put into operation, in the event of short-term capital flows to or from third countries leading to serious disturbances in the domestic monetary situation and the stability of exchange rate relationships in the European Monetary System. Without prejudice to these provisions, the Commis\\xadsion shall recommend to the Member States that such of the instruments mentioned in Article 2 as it deems fit be put into operation, in the event of short-term capital flows to or from third countries leading to serious disturbances in the domestic monetary sit\\xaduation and the stability of exchange rate relationships in the European Monetary System. 3. When the instruments mentioned in Article 2 are applied, the Commission shall ensure close coor\\xaddination between the authorities of the Member States. 3. When the instruments mentioned in Article 2 are applied, the Commission shall ensure close coor\\xaddination between the authorities of the Member States, in particular to ensure that the objectives which the liberalization of capital movements within the Community seeks to achieve are not frustrated. During the application of the instruments men\\xadtioned in Article 2, the Member State concerned and the Commission shall consult at least once every three months to consider whether it is desirable to prolong such measures. embodying the opinion of the European Parliament on the proposal from the Commission of the European Communities to the Council on a directive amending Directive 72/156/EEC on regulat\\xad Council regulation establishing a single facility providing medium-term financial support for Member States' balances of payments The granting of loans as medium-term financial support to a Member State not taking part in the EMS exchange-rate mechanism shall be subject to its accepting exchange-rate discipline, the arrangements for which shall be determined when the loan is granted. The Council, having due regard to the circumstances, shall decide to mobilize such claims, in particular in accordance with one of the following proce\\xaddures, or a combination thereof: Member States that are creditors under this facility experience difficulties as regard their balance of payments and/or a sudden decline in their foreign currency reserves to dangerously low levels, they may request mobilization of their claims. The Council, having due regard to the circumstances, shall decide to mobilize such claims, in particular in accordance with one of the following procedures, or a combination thereof: embodying the opinion of the European Parliament on the proposal from the Commission of the European Communities to the Council for a regulation establishing a single facility providing — having been consulted by the Council pursuant to Article 235 of the EEC Treaty (Doc. C2-130/87), — having regard to the report of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy and the opinion of the Committee on Budgets (Doc. A2-70/88), 3. Calls on the Council to consult Parliament again should it intend to make substantial modifications to the Commission's proposal; TEXT PROPOSED TEXT AMENDED BY THE COUNCIL BY THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT Council Decision establishing a Court of First Instance of the European Communities 4.

The Court of First Instance shall exercise at first instance the jurisdiction conferred on the Court Of Justice by the Treaties establishing the Communities and by the acts adopted in implementation thereof: The following provisions shall be inserted after Article 43 of the Protocol on the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Economic Community: Such further and more detailed provisions as may be necessary shall be laid down in the Rules of Procedure established in accordance with the fourth paragraph of Article 168a of this Treaty. 2.

A2-107/88), — having regard to the result of the vote on the proposal for a Council decision drawn up by the Court of justice, 2. Calls on Council to incorporate the above amendments in the decision which is to be adopted pursuant to Article 32d of the ECSC Treaty, Article 168a of the EEC Treaty and Article 140a of the EAEC Treaty; • Council decision on the common position to be adopted by Member States when signing and ratifying the United Nations Convention on Conditions for the Registration-of Ships embodying the opinion of the European Parliament on the proposal for a Council decision on the common position to be adopted by Member States when signing and ratifying the United Nations — having been consulted by the Parliament pursuant to Article 75 of the EEC Treaty (Doc. C2-188/87), — having regard to the report of the Committee on T ransport and the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens Rights (Doc. A2-53/88), 1. Approves the Commission's proposal subject to Parliament's amendments and in accord\\xadance with the vote thereon; — having regard to the draft Treaty establishing the European Union adopted on 14 February 1984, — having regard to the Declaration on Democracy adopted by the European Council on 8 April 1978, — having regard to its resolutions of 16 January (2) and 8 October 1986 (3), in which it criticizes the democratic shortfalls in the institutional system of the European Community, — having regard to its resolution of 17 June 1987 on the strategy of the European Parliament for achieving European Union (4) particularly recitals I, J and L and paragraph 9 thereof, 1. Notes that large numbers of official statements make it clear that the Member States consider that European integration must be founded on the basic principles of democracy; 4. Notes that in the institutional system of the European Community, the Council, composed of members of the Member States' governments, who at European Community level are not subject to any form of democratic parliamentary control, simultaneously holds both legislative and executive power, 5. Notes that a sizeable share of the powers exercised by the Council were held by the Member States' parliaments before being transferred to the Community; 6. Notes also that the Council's legislative activity constantly entails new limitations on the powers of the national parliaments, and thereby entails a continual shrinking of democratic parliamentary rights in the Community; 7. Points out that generally speaking these limitations derive from Article 5 of the EEC Treaty, which requires the Member States to abstain 'from any measure which could jeopardize the attainment of the objectives of this Treaty'; 8. Points out that in practice the limitations on the powers of national parliaments may involve either a loss of power to pass laws or an obligation to adopt certain implementing or contingency measures or to refrain from using the powers reserved to them, without those powers being transferred to the European Parliament, in a way which compromises the democratic legitimacy of its decisions; Deeply regrets the 'democratic deficit' thus created and the consequent limitation of Parliament's right to be involved in the creation of European Community law; Considers that the danger of bureaucratization and estrangement from the popular will is compounded in the case of questions withdrawn from the scope of national parliaments, and therefore from national debate, since citizens feel alienated from large areas of Community decision-making while they lack the natural mediation which control by Parliament would imply; Stresses, moreover, that at European Community level the right of joint decision accorded to the European Parliament is too limited; Considers that the concentration of legislative powers in the hands of the members of governments meeting in Council and the way in which that power is exercised, particularly the fact that legislation is adopted behind closed doors, have created an institutional imbalance which is responsible not only for a democratic shortfall but also for a low level of effectiveness in the Community's work; Considers that this state of affairs may well undermine the dual legitimacy of the Com\\xadmunity's authority, consisting as it does in the national legitimacy displayed in the Council via governments enjoying the trust of their parliaments and Community legitimacy expressed by Parliament, which is elected by direct universal suffrage and to which the Commission is accountable; Stresses that this democratic deficit can be remedied only at the level of the Community itself, by a redistribution of powers between the Council and Parliament; Urges the Member States' governments, the Council and Commission, in the interests of the Community as much, at long last to satisfy Parliaments's legitimate claim to play a full part in the Community's decision-making process; Points in this spirit to the requirement expressed in its resolution of 17 June 1987 that the European Parliament to be elected in 1989 be commissioned to draw up a plan for European Union to be submitted for ratification to the appropriate national authorities; Requests that the resolutions and declarations adopted by the European Parliament on the subject of institutional reform be discussed at the next meeting of the European Council in Hanover and the relevant decisions taken on them; Considers that due account must be taken of fundamental democratic principles in the reform and further development of the Community into a political union and that all the citizens of Europe must as far as possible be involved in this process, and calls — wherever this is constitutionally possible — for referendums to be held in the Member States, so as to give the governments and parliaments a picture of the electorate's views on the European Union and the tasks of the European Parliament; Calls on the Member States' parliaments to regard the problem of the democratic deficit created by the present method of integration as a problem shared by all parliaments and to work together to seek solutions, in conjuction with the European Parliament; Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission and the parliaments and governments of the Member States. — having regard to the motion for a resolution by Mr Roelants du Vivier on the draft treaty on European Union and a procedure for petitioning for a European referendum (Doc. B2-623/86), — having regard to the report of the Committee on Institutional Affairs and the opinion of the Committee on Youth, Culture, Education, Information and Sport (Doc. A2-106/85), (b) the transformation of the Community into a political union will have important direct consequences on the life of all European citizens, B. whereas one of essential components of democracy is a high degree of public participation in the political process; whereas this participation takes the form of the periodic choice of representatives elected on the basis of alternative proposals put forward by political parties, but may also, in special circumstances, take the form of specific consultation on legislative matters or on decisions of particular importance, C. whereas the forms and procedures used for these consultations vary from country to country, including the Member States of the European Community, some of which make no provision for this facility, while in others it is governed by the Constitution or ordinary laws, with considerable variations in the frequency with which it is used, G. whereas, furthermore, the people of Europe vote regularly and in a responsible manner to elect their representatives to the European Parliament and thus constitute a unified electorate whose view on the question of how powers within the Community should be allocated is of major importance, i H. whereas an expression of public support for European political union would be a powerful stimulus to the European Council to assign to the Parliament to be elected in 1989 the task of drawing up the institutional reforms necessary for establishing political union, I. welcoming the fact that certain Member States have taken parliamentary initiatives with a view to holding popular consultations at national level on political union, 3. Stresses that such exploratory soundings would give an important indication of opinion as to political union and the part to be played by Parliament in bringing it about, and would enable the bodies concerned to ascertain the will of Europe's citizens on a fundamental political decision; 4. Hopes that the parliament elected in 1989 will be able to fulfil the task of drawing up a proposal for the establishment of European political union; 5. Considers that the proposal for political union which emerges should be submitted in due course for ratification by the Member States, in accordance with the provisions of their respective constitutions; 7. Notes that where it is impossible to hold national consultations, a possible alternative might be to adopt a similar strategy involving explicit reference to these institutional objectives in the manifestos of the parties contesting the next European elections or the holding of a Community-wide opinion poll or of various polls simultaneously in the Member States, so as to establish the wishes of European citizens in this matter, > 9. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the European Council, the Council, the Commission of the European Communities and the Presidents of the parliaments of the Member States. — having regard to the articles of the EEC Treaty concerning the Community's activities in the international arena, and more particularly Articles 228,229,230,231,237 and 238, and to the provisions of the Single European Act on cooperation in external policy, — having regard to the Court of Justice's case law on these aspects of Community activity which establishes that external trade should be regulated in a spirit of openness on the basis of common priniples of unity and solidarity, — having regard to the Draft Treaty establishing the European Union drawn up by Parliament and, in particular, Articles 63 to 69, — having regard to the provisions of its Rules of Procedure concerning the Community's relations with third countries and, in particular, Rules 31 to 35, the resolution of 18 February 1982 (') on the role of the European Parliament in the negotiation and ratification of treaties of accession and of other treaties and agreements between the European Community and third countries, the resolution of 9 July 1981 (2) on European Political Cooperation and the European Parliament's role, the resolution of 7 October 1986 (3) on relations between the European Parliament and the Commission and Council respectively, the resolution of 11 December 1986 (4) on the Single European Act and the resolution of 11 March 1988 (5) on EEC-UNO relations, — convinced that the European Parliament should, more than ever before, exercise effective and strict control over the external activities of the Commission and the Council within the powers conferred on it by the EEC Treaty as modified by the Single European Act, — having regard to the report of the Political Affairs Committee and the opinions of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights, the Committee on Institutional Affairs and the Committee on External Economic Relations (Doc. A2-86/88), 4. Stresses the need, in the interests of close collaboration between the three institutions in the field of international agreements, for a procedure for consultation and debate, as provided for in paragraphs 1 and 2 of Rule 33 of its Rules of Procedure; 5. Reiterates its view that the introduction, by the amendment of Articles 237 and 238 of the EEC Treaty, of the assent procedure into the processes of accession of new Member States and of association with third countries represents one of the most significant achievements of the SEA in granting to the EP that co-decisional role, together with the Council of Ministers, which Parlia\\xadment, as the legitimate representative of the citizens of Europe, demands; 6. Points out, nevertheless, that, as recent experience has shown, the conferrment of this co-decisional power must be complemented by the adoption of a series of provisions which will enable Parliament to play a political role not only in the final decision concluding the negotia\\xadtions, but also in determining the scope of the latter; 7. Believes, therefore, that the existing LUNS-WESTERTERP procedure for consultation between Parliament and Council must be supplemented and redefined to take account of the requirements and new responsibilities ensuing from the Single European Act in order to allow the timely exchange of information and opinions, so that the course of the ne negotiation process and the final decision-making by both Institutions may be facilitated; 8. Stresses that this also applies to accession treaties under Article 237, second subparagraph, of the EEC Treaty and calls on the Council and the Commission to take appropriate steps during the accession negotiations; 9. Instructs its Political Affairs Committee to draw up a further report on the application of Parliament's powers under Article 237, as amended by the Single European Act; this should examine, in particular, at what stage the Parliament should give its assent to further enlargement as well as explore the conditions of entry for new members to the EC in the light of the Single European Act; Stresses the need for the exchange of information and opinions to begin from the moment the Council adopts the Commission's negotiating mandate, and consequently thinks it advisable that a rapporteur responsible for monitoring the progress of the negotiations should be appointed within the appropriate parliamentary committee to ensure full knowledge and information on the matter, Equally sees the need for close cooperation on formulating Parliament's position among the various parliamentary committees, and more particularly the Political Affairs Committee, the Committee on External Economic Relations and the Committee on Development and Cooper\\xadation, whether their role is that of committee responsible or committee asked for its opinion; Points out that the annual debate on the Commission's Legislative Programme should include mention of plans for future agreements to be negotiated and concluded by the Commu\\xadnity; calls on the Commission to submit to Parliament, at the latter's request, estimates of the impact of those agreements on the Community's internal policies; Reserves the right, when giving its view on an accession treaty or an association agreement, to set out in a separate resolution the conditions which Parliament regards as necessary for the implementation of each agreement to be politically consistent; Points out, lastly, that in the interests of mutual goodwill the Commission and the Council should not interpret restrictively the legal bases of international agreements, since this might in practice amount to reducing Parliament's existing powers; Observes that its vote on a request for its assent made by the Council and bearing on an association agreement, its extension or modification is a sovereign act of Parliament which closes the procedure for the request of its assent; Considers that there is a need for an annual debate to be held on the European identity in external policy and security policy matters at the time that the Council's report on European Union is submitted; Considers it necessary for Parliament to be informed of the progress achieved in the field of EPC through the EPC Presidency and by the Commission, which shall also report to Parliament, in this connection, urges the Commission to collaborate closely in promoting effective and more democratic political cooperation, with a view to achieving European Union; Points out that it should be possible to extend the contacts established in the form of the quarterly colloquies between the Presidency-in-Office of EPC and the Political Affairs Committee to additional extraordinary meetings when matters of great importance or urgency arise, and that such meetings might take the form of hearings, as happens in some national parliaments, this would be particularly useful in relation to mattters of security policy since it would facilitate the adoption by the Community institutions of a common standpoint in this area also and thereby help to insure that the European Comminity is represented at international level in discussions and negotiations on the central issues of security policy; Points to the need to create an appropriate mechanism whereby the Presidency-in-Office of EPC can report to Parliament in plenary sitting, as a regular item of its agenda, on the extent to which account has been taken of resolutions adopted by Parliament and of the views expressed by Parliament on matters relating to EPC, in accordance with Article 30 (4) of the Single Act; Instructs its President to enter into negotiations with the Council and the Commission with the aim of reaching an inter-institutional agreement on the aspects of this Resolution affecting inter-institutional relations and notably those contained in paragraphs 6, 7, 8 and 10; Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission, the Presidency of European Political Cooperation and to the Governments and Parliaments of the Member States. — having regard to the Commission communication to the Council of 29 October 1981 on the social integration of handicapped people (2) and to the Council resolution of 21 December 1981 on the same subject (3), 2. Calls on the Commission to make a proposal to the Council concerning official recognition of the sign language used by deaf people in each Member State; 4. Stresses the importance of recognizing sign language interpreting as a profession and of establishing full-time sigh language interpreter training and employment programmes in each Member State under the responsibility of the national associations for the deaf; 5. Urges Member States, in consultation with the European Regional Secretariat of the World Federation of the Deaf (WFD), to submit projects for the training of sufficient numbers of sign language tutors, assessors and interpreters, for support under the European Social Fund; 6. Calls upon Community institutions to set an example by making provision, as a matter of principle, for sign language interpretation at meetings organized under their auspices and attended by deaf people; 7. Calls upon broadcasting authorities to include translation into sign language, or at least sub-titles, of television news programmes, those of political interest and, to the extent possible, of a selection of cultural and general interest programmes; also urges broadcasting authorities, in consultation with the European Regional Secretariat for the Deaf and the European Broadcasting Union, to determine minimum levels of provision of sign language interpretation or sub-titling for programmes aimed at adults and children respectively, as well as of teletext provision; 8. Urges Member States to ensure that all relevant government circulars on welfare benefits, health and employment are produced using sign language on video for the use of the deaf community; Calls upon Member States, in cooperation with the Commission, to support pilot projects aimed at teaching sign language to hearing children and adults, using deaf people trained for the purpose, and to back research in this area; Urges Member States to support research into and publication of up-to-date dictionaries of their respective national sign languages; invites the Commission to foster such activities and in due course to promote development of multilingual dictionaries of the sign languages in use within the Community; Invites the Commission to consider how, at a suitable juncture, Community-level exchanges might best be brought about between those proficient in their respective countries' sign languages and cultures; Considers it essential that the deaf be fully involved in determining policy for the non-hearing at national and Community level, notably through the European Regional Secretariat of the WFD; Calls for more generous funding under the Community budget for development of services for deaf people in the Member States; Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Commission, the Council, the Member States, the European Regional Secretariat of the World Federation of the Deaf, and the European Broadcasting Union. on protectionism in trade relations between the European Community and the United States of America — having regard to its resolution of 13 December 1985 on protectionism in trade relations between the European Community and the United States of America (2), — having regard to the report by the Committee on External Economic Relations and the opinions of the Political Affairs Committee and of the Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Doc. A2-89/88), H. deeply concerned at the present fragility of the international economic environment, as typified by the crisis in world stock markets in the last months of 1987, and which is due to the present excessive influence of speculative capital flows on international trade resulting largely from the volatile nature of exchange rates, 5. Considers that different traditions and methods, in the EC and in the US, respectively, regarding economic policy and in particular structural adjustment, account for important diver\\xadgences in the trade legislation systems, and that common ground should be sought in GATT, by means in particular of a better definition of domestic subsidies; Notes that most of the industrialized States and trading blocks, including the EC and the US, have used the possibility of imposing antidumping or countervailing duties on their suppliers in order to induce them to undertake so-called 'gray area' arrangements such as 'voluntary export restraint' and 'orderly marketing' agreements, which are far less transparent than traditional tariff barriers; 7. Considers that the failure of the main industrialized States and trading blocks to adopt a coordinated approach to the economic recession of the early 1980s aimed at growth-led recovery, induced many to introduce covert forms of protectionism; 8. Considers that such measures, particularly frequent in the steel, textiles, car and consumer electronics sectors, though justifiable as short-term palliatives against the sudden collapse of important industries, nevertheless in the longer term tend to distort and ossify production and trade patterns, and entail considerable economic costs, while frequently hampering industriali\\xadzation in some LDC's and providing unjustifiable bonuses to other suppliers; Considers that the US/EC steel agreement, ending in September 1989, which resulted from the need to protect the US steel industry against an artificially high US dollar, has contributed to the international market-sharing in the steel sector, with heavy economic costs both for US consumers and EC workers and producers; Notes that EC/US trade relations in the agriculture sector are subject to recurrent crises, and considers that a balanced and lasting settlement of the unresolved problems must be reached, respecting the principle of the comprehensive nature of the negotiations and in compliance with GATT rules; Considers that, in conformity with the OECD ministerial communique of 19 May 1988 the EC and the US should seek to agree in the Uruguay Round on a framework approach which includes 'short term as well as long term elements which will promote the reform process as launched last year and relieve current strains in agricultural markets'; this approach should not involve, however, practices such as international market-sharing for agricultural exports'; Emphasizes the need for the European Parliament to play a greater role in monitoring all aspects of trade in the agricultural sector at world level; decides, to this end, to set up an ad hoc working party composed of members of the Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Committee on External Economic Relations which will be responsible for: Stresses that the present volatility of exchange rates carries unfavourable consequences for the world economy, in terms of financial costs and reduced investments; stresses also the lack of responsibility of the US Administration in the pursuit of fiscal policies since 1983, having regard to the dollar's role in the world economy; Welcomes the reductions in the US budget deficit enacted on 22 December 1987 by President Reagan, but points to the fact that further reductions will be needed in the next years in order to reduce fundamental imbalances on world financial and merchandise markets; Stresses the importance of the EMS as a zone of comparative stability, and considers that the strengthening of the ECU, in particular through its wider use in contracts and sales, as well as a widening of this zone, would be an important contribution by the Community in combating the consequences of exchange rate volatility; Reaffirms its belief that protectionism does not provide any lasting economic advantage to the State resorting to it, and is particularly misleading as the political debate rarely succeeds in making clear to the public the economic costs of protectionist measures and the way that the division of revenue between, producers, workers and consumers will be affected by them; Is concerned by the gradual weakening of the GATT open multilateral trade system, caused notably by the trend towards bilateralism and by the proliferation of 'orderly marketing agree\\xadments' and 'voluntary restraints', and maintains that the EC and the US could play an important role in the defence of free trade, by steadily reducing the use of such instruments which are by essence non-transparent, difficult to evaluate in political debate, and specifically geared to narrow sectoral interests; the EC and the US should also consult with the other producer countries in GATT to introduce greater discipline and transparency in their agricultural policies; Points out the contribution that the European Community will make to liberalization and transparency in the exchange of goods and services through the completion of its large internal market and stresses that the liberalization of trade between the Community and its trading partners is as important for European consumers as free trade within the Community; Calls for the completion of the internal market to be accompanied by a firm and consistent external policy towards the United States and other developed countries, based on the dual principle of openness and reciprocity and capable of ensuring the defence of the legitimate interests of the European Community, while increasing its contribution to the liberalization of international trade; Instructs the President to forward this resolution to the Commission, the Council and the United States Congress and Administration. Council Directive on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the tread depth of tyres of certain categories of motor vehicles and of their trailers Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 75 there\\xadof, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 100a thereof, TEXT PROPOSED BY THE COMMISSION TEXT AMENDED OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES BY THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT categories Ml, Nl,  Ol and 02,  as defined in Annex I to Council Directive 70/156/EEC (') shall not be fitted with tyres having a tread depth, measured in the immediate proximity of the tread wear indicator, of less than 1,6 mm. After consulting the Commission Member States shall adopt and publish before 31 December 1988 the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary for the implementation of this Directive from 30 June 1989. — Draft legislative resolution Doc. A2-34/88: Vote adjourned (matter referred back to committee (Rule 40(2)). — having regard to the study carried out for the Commission on certain aspects of the cost of non-Europe in the field of the internal market, — having regard to the 'Padoa-Schioppa Report' to the Commission on the consequences of creating a single internal market, in particular concerning its efficiency, stability and equi\\xadty ('), — having regard to the report of the Committee on Institutional Affairs on the democratic deficit (Doc. A2-276/87), — having regard to its written declaration of 16 May 1988 on the European Parliament's powers and the convening of the 'European States-General' (2), I. whereas monetary union would enable the European Community, as the world's largest trading bloc, to play its urgently needed role in stabilizing the world's key currencies and in reducing interest rates, R. whereas these savings total at least 120 billion ECUs, all of which would recur annually, that some would also increase the Community's annual rate of growth, and that the dynamic effect of lower costs, lower interest rates, greater trade and greater flexibility in fiscal policy, hand in hand with proper structural policies, would reduce the burden of unemployment, use the full productive potential of the Community and raise dramatically the wealth of the poorer Member States, S. whereas the huge importance of what is at stake for the countries and citizens of the European Community confirms the need to continue the process of institutional reform begun with the Single European Act, 1. Considers that putting the aims of the Single Act into effect, particularly as regards the internal market and economic and social cohesion, will make for substantial savings on overall public spending by the Member States; 3. Considers that the Community's institutional system should aim to ensure transparency in the decision-making process, in particular through the provision of more information to public opinion and the national parliaments regarding the advantages which the proposed decisions would confer at Community level, given that it is at present, national viewpoints which, at the moment of decision-taking in Council, prevail in media reports to the detriment of Community points of view; 4. Considers that the proper running of the Community institutions, and the attainment of the objectives set out in the Single Act, are adversely effected by the exclusive monopoly of decision-taking powers held by the Council, the members of which are motivated, as a matter of priority, by the defence of national interests which are often contradictory in the short term, and considers that it is necessary to change the working arrangements of the Council so as to enable the European Community to achieve its objectives and to ensure that the savings which can and should be made are made; Consequently: (a) it should be possible for Community interests to be taken into account by involving the European Parliament to a more significant degree in the decision-taking process in general and the legislative process in particular, (b) when the Council has not succeeded in adopting a common position within a reasonable period of time, the Commission and Parliament should be able to decide on it, 5. Considers that the Member States and institutions of the Community should ensure that the changes in the Treaty (c) disencumber the decision-making procedures in Parliament and the Council of all matters of detail, which, being regulatory in character, should be the province of the Commission's implementing powers, 6. Calls upon the Member States to pursue urgently their discussions on the future establish\\xadment of an independent Community Central Bank; to consider the role that might J>e played in moving towards such a development by the existing Committee of National Central Banks; and to examine the eventual institutional relationships between the Community Central Bank, the present Community institutions and the national monetary authorities; 8. Considers that, apart from the changes that would require Treaty amendment, the Com\\xadmission, the Council and the European Parliament should immediately consider how many changes could be operated informally, for example, on the basis of an inter-institutional agree\\xadment, in order to remove the cost of non-Europe and take the urgently needed decisions as rapidly as possible; 9. Considers that the next step towards European Union, regarding which Parliament will be making precise proposals in the near future pursuant to its resolution of 17 June 1987 (') and following its discussions with national parliament's, should incorporate these changes; Asks its President to make appropriate proposals for making the contents of the report on the costs of non-Europe as widely known to the general public as possible and restates its decision of 17 June 1987 to finance information campaigns to promote the achievement of European Union; Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission, the Foreign Ministers meeting in European Political Cooperation and the governments of the Mem\\xadber States. A. having regard to the Third Report on the implementation of the Commission's White Paper on completing the internal market (COM(88) 134 final), B. having regard to the backlog which the Council has allowed to accumulate in the adoption of proposals submitted by the Commission, E. whereas the implementation of the programme for the completion of the internal market cannot be divorced from the many decisions to be taken in respect of economic and social cohesion, 1. Points out that the future of the Community depends on completing the internal market by 1992, expresses its anxiety at the backlog in the Council as regards the adoption of the Commis\\xadsion's proposals on the single market and considers that, were the backlog not to be cleared, the credibility of the 1992 deadline would be called into question; 2. Notes that it will probably be very difficult to bring a genuine internal market into being by 1992, given the wide disparities between the various States and regions of the Community, and therefore considers it essential that there should be a substantial increase in the funds intended for structural purposes; 3. Calls on the Commission to put forward a new timetable for the adoption of the proposals currently pending before Council, selecting certain priorities and submitting proposals for making up the current serious delays; 4. Believes that the Community can only strengthen its economic cohesion in the face of international competition if, at the same time, it substantially increases its social and regional cohesion, which will make the completion of the single market possible; 5. Considers, if care is not taken, that a Europe seen in purely economic terms, closely resembling a free-trade area but without the necessary accompanying policies, would be very likely in the end to threaten the very existence of the Community; 8. Restates its attachment to the principle of the complete liberalization of capital movements within the Community and hopes that, during the transitional period, the Twelve will make considerable progress on strengthening the EMS, which must include all the Community curren\\xadcies; believes that the rules which protect people's savings must also be harmonized; 9. Calls for increased convergence in the economic and monetary policies pursued by the Member States and for the ECU to be given a more important role to play in the Community and the world through various measures designed to enhance its character as a fully-fledged curren\\xadcy; A. whereas, following the European Council in Brussels, the European Council in Hannover should mark a new stage in the tradition whereby the Heads of State and Government, at their meetings, determine the political area of agreement and the political framework which then dictate the tenor of the detailed decisions reached in the special-subject Councils, C. having regard to the need to establish the single market in accordance with the principles of the social market economy so as to prevent a fresh concentration of economic activity coming about in the industrialized areas at the expense of the less industrialized areas, and to ensure that the increased competition of the open market will work to the advantage of consumers without impeding the dialogue which must take place between employers and labour, F. having regard to the need to enhance the role of the European Parliament with a view to making the European Community's decision-making process more democratic, 1. Proposes that the European Council set up a workirig party responsible for determining, within a year and for the European Council itself, the conditions on which a European currency and, consequently, an independent European Central Bank, a Bank of the European States, should be set up and the stages in which this should be carried out; the Council of Ministers, the Commission, the European Parliament, the governments and parliaments of the Member States and the Central.Banks should be represented on this working party; 2. Reminds the European Council that, irrespective of the doubling of the structural Funds, account must be taken, firstly, of the 'cost of the periphery' when directives for the creation of the internal market are being drawn up and adopted, so that the peripheral regions may become properly integrated in the single market and benefit from the Community's economic develop\\xadment and, secondly, measures must be introduced to safeguard the social dimension of the internal market, particularly by fighting unemployment, above all youth unemployment, with regard to safety at the workplace, to the situation of migrant workers in the Community, to the right of workers to information and participation, to the right to work, to social security and professional training; takes the view that every appropriate legislative measure must be taken at Community level to bring about the European social area to which Community citizens aspire; 3. Draws the Commission's and Council's attention to the urgent need to ensure the Commu\\xadnity's technological competitiveness at home and abroad by making vigorous use of all instru\\xadments without affecting the working of the market economy; 4. Would like the European Council to draw up a consistent programme to guarantee internal security, encompassing terrorism, drug trafficking, crime, legislation on weapons, the right of asylum, aliens' rights and visa requirements, reciprocal legal and administrative assistance between Member States and common security on the external frontiers; a mandate to this effect should be given to the Ministers of the Interior of the Member States, who should work closely with the Commission to this end; 5. Asks for the priorities already determined, i.e. granting Community citizens a blanket right of residence, mutual recognition of qualifications and a general right to medical treatment, to be put into effect as soon as possible; would like the Commission to give thorough consideration to the question of implementing the conclusions of the Adonnino report on a People's Europe; proposes that the European Council set up an 'Adonnino Committee II' to submit proposals before the European Council meeting in December 1988, for further progress towards achieving a People's Europe; — having regard to the Third Report from the Commission to the Council and to the European Parliament on the implementation of the Commission's White Paper on completing the internal market (COM(88) 134 final), — the extent and number of the measures contained in the White Paper generally mean that they require periods of adjustment if they are to be implemented as effectively as possible by the national authorities and economic operators as a whole, 3. Draws the Council's attention to the risks that the considerable delay in Council proceedings is causing to the completion of the internal market by 1992, whereas the Commission has submitted most of its proposals and the European Parliament is providing positive cooperation in this legislative task which is essential to the future of the Community; — instructs the Council of Ministers for the Interior, in close cooperation with the Commission, to implement the necessary provisions, particularly as regards the status of non-EEC nation\\xadals, the right of asylum, rules on the keeping of firearms, combating terrorism and drug trafficking; 6. Considers that the Commission, in coordination with the European Parliament, must exert very heavy pressure this year to obtain from the Council a genuine commitment to the large market without internal frontiers, and in particular to its effective completion by 1992; 8. Calls on the Commission to take the necessary steps, for the next report on completing the internal market which it must submit to the Council before the end of the year (Article 8b of the Treaty), to allow for the accumulated delay to be made up; 9. Asks Council to counteract the foreseen loss in employment in the short term by accom\\xadpanying measures to stimulate the European economy; believes that the Cecchini Report demon\\xadstrates more than ever the need for a concerted growth strategy to be implemented; Asks the Commission to give maximum publicity to the study it has drawn up on 1992: a challenge for Europe; and to draw attention at the same time, and with equal emphasis, to the studies on the problems of redistributing the benefits of the large internal market between social groupings, sectoral activities, Member States, regions, etc., in line with the conclusions of the Padoa-Schioppa report; Asks the Commission to link advances towards the large market scheduled for 1992 with similar progress on the other indissociable components of Community integration, particularly in the fields of economic and social cohesion and monetary affairs; Calls on the Commission, finally, to submit as soon as possible this year the mid-term report on completing the single internal market provided for in the Single Act, to analyze the situation objectively in this report, and to present the proposals needed to ensure that the deadline of 1992 is irreversible. — whereas, on 23 April 1986, the Court of Justice of the European Communities annulled the decision of Parliament's Bureau of 12 October 1982 allocating the appropriations entered in Item 3708 of the general budget and the decision of Parliament's Enlarged Bureau of 29 October 1983 on the use of the appropriations for reimbursement of the expenditure incurred by the political groupings having taken part in the 1984 direct elections, 2.

This Regulation replaces previous Directives and Decisions concerning food additives permitted for use in foods with a view to ensuring the effective functioning of the internal market whilst ensuring a high level of protection of human health and a high level of consumer protection, including the protection of consumer interests, via comprehensive and streamlined procedures. This Regulation harmonises the use of food additives in foods in the Community. This includes the use of food additives in foods covered by Council Directive 89/398/EEC of 3 May 1989 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to foodstuffs intended for particular nutritional uses\\xa0( 3 ) and the use of certain food colours for the health marking of meat and the decoration and stamping of eggs. Food additives are substances that are not normally consumed as food itself but are added to food intentionally for a technological purpose described in this Regulation, such as the preservation of food. All food additives should be covered by this Regulation, and therefore in the light of scientific progress and technological development the list of functional classes should be updated. However, substances should not be considered as food additives when they are used for the purpose of imparting flavour and/or taste or for nutritional purposes, such as salt replacers, vitamins and minerals. Moreover, substances considered as foods which may be used for a technological function, such as sodium chloride or saffron for colouring and food enzymes should also not fall within the scope of this Regulation. However, preparations obtained from foods and other natural source material that are intended to have a technological effect in the final food and which are obtained by selective extraction of constituents (e.g. pigments) relative to the nutritive or aromatic constituents, should be considered additives within the meaning of this Regulation. Finally, food enzymes are covered by Regulation (EC) No 1332/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2008 on food enzymes\\xa0( 4 ), which excludes the application of this Regulation. Substances not consumed as food itself but used intentionally in the processing of foods, which only remain as residues in the final food and do not have a technological effect in the final product (processing aids), should not be covered by this Regulation. Food additives should be approved and used only if they fulfil the criteria laid down in this Regulation. Food additives must be safe when used, there must be a technological need for their use, and their use must not mislead the consumer and must be of benefit to the consumer. Misleading the consumer includes, but is not limited to, issues related to the nature, freshness, quality of ingredients used, the naturalness of a product or of the production process, or the nutritional quality of the product, including its fruit and vegetable content. The approval of food additives should also take into account other factors relevant to the matter under consideration including societal, economic, traditional, ethical and environmental factors, the precautionary principle and the feasibility of controls. The use and maximum levels of a food additive should take into account the intake of the food additive from other sources and the exposure to the food additive by special groups of consumers (e.g. allergic consumers). Food additives must comply with the approved specifications, which should include information to adequately identify the food additive, including origin, and to describe the acceptable criteria of purity. The specifications previously developed for food additives included in Commission Directive 95/31/EC of 5 July 1995 laying down specific criteria of purity concerning sweeteners for use in foodstuffs\\xa0( 5 ), Commission Directive 95/45/EC of 26 July 1995 laying down specific purity criteria concerning colours for use in foodstuffs\\xa0( 6 ) and Commission Directive 96/77/EC of 2 December 1996 laying down specific purity criteria on food additives other than colours and sweeteners\\xa0( 7 ) should be maintained until the corresponding additives are entered in the Annexes to this Regulation. At that time, the specifications related to such additives should be set out in a Regulation. Those specifications should relate directly to the additives included in the Community lists in the Annexes to this Regulation. However, considering the complex character and substance of such specifications, for the sake of clarity they should not be integrated as such in the Community lists but should be set out in one or more separate Regulations. Some food additives are permitted for specific uses for certain authorised oenological practices and processes. The use of such food additives should comply with this Regulation and with the specific provisions laid down in the relevant Community legislation. In order to ensure harmonisation, the risk assessment and approval of food additives should be carried out in accordance with the procedure laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1331/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2008 establishing a common authorisation procedure for food additives, food enzymes and food flavourings\\xa0( 8 ) Under Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2002 laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety\\xa0( 9 ), the European Food Safety Authority (hereinafter referred to as the Authority) is to be consulted on matters likely to affect public health. A food additive which falls within the scope of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 on genetically modified food and feed\\xa0( 10 ) should be authorised in accordance with that Regulation as well as under this Regulation. A food additive already approved under this Regulation which is prepared by production methods or using starting materials significantly different from those included in the risk assessment of the Authority, or different from those covered by the specifications laid down, should be submitted for evaluation by the Authority. ‘Significantly different’ could mean, inter alia, a change of the production method from extraction from a plant to production by fermentation using a micro-organism or a genetic modification of the original micro-organism, a change in starting materials, or a change in particle size, including the use of nanotechnology. Food additives should be kept under continuous observation and must be re-evaluated whenever necessary in the light of changing conditions of use and new scientific information. Member States which maintained on 1 January 1992 prohibitions on the use of certain additives in certain specific foods which are considered traditional and are produced on their territory should be permitted to continue to apply those prohibitions. Moreover, as regard products such as ‘Feta’ or ‘Salame cacciatore’, this Regulation should be without prejudice to more restrictive rules linked to the use of certain denominations under Council Regulation (EC) No 510/2006 of 20 March 2006 on the protection of geographical indications and designations of origin for agricultural products and foodstuffs\\xa0( 11 ) and Council Regulation (EC) No 509/2006 of 20 March 2006 on agricultural products and foodstuffs as traditional specialities guaranteed\\xa0( 12 ). Unless subject to further restrictions, an additive may be present in food, other than by direct addition, as a result of carry-over from an ingredient in which the additive was permitted, provided that the level of the additive in the final food is no greater than would be introduced by the use of the ingredient under proper technological conditions and good manufacturing practice. Food additives remain subject to the general labelling obligations as provided for in Directive 2000/13/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 March 2000 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs\\xa0( 13 ) and, as the case may be, in Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 and in Regulation (EC) No 1830/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 concerning the traceability and labelling of genetically modified organisms and the traceability of food and feed products produced from genetically modified organisms\\xa0( 14 ). In addition, specific provisions on the labelling of food additives sold as such to the manufacturer or to the final consumer should be contained in this Regulation. Sweeteners authorised under this Regulation may be used in table-top sweeteners sold directly to consumers. Manufacturers of such products should make information available to the consumer by appropriate means to allow them to use the product in a safe manner. Such information could be made available in a number of ways including on product labels, Internet websites, consumer information lines or at the point of sale. The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission\\xa0( 15 ). In particular the Commission should be empowered to amend the Annexes of this Regulation and to adopt appropriate transitional measures. Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation, inter alia, by supplementing it with new non-essential elements, they must be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC. On grounds of efficiency, the normal time-limits for the regulatory procedure with scrutiny should be curtailed for the adoption of certain amendments to Annexes II and III relating to substances already authorised under other Community law as well as any appropriate transitional measures related to these substances. In order to develop and update Community law on food additives in a proportionate and effective way, it is necessary to collect data, share information and coordinate work between Member States. For that purpose, it may be useful to undertake studies to address specific issues with a view to facilitating the decision-making process. The financing of such measures is covered by Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on official controls performed to ensure the verification of compliance with feed and food law, animal health and animal welfare rules\\xa0( 16 ). Since the objective of this Regulation, namely to lay down Community rules on food additives, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, in the interests of market unity and a high level of consumer protection, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective. Following the adoption of this Regulation the Commission, assisted by the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health, should review all the existing authorisations for criteria, other than safety, such as intake, technological need and the potential to mislead the consumer. All food additives that are to continue to be authorised in the Community should be transferred to the Community lists in Annexes II and III to this Regulation. Annex III to this Regulation should be completed with the other food additives used in food additives and food enzymes as well as carriers for nutrients and their conditions of use in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1331/2008 [establishing a common authorisation procedure for food additives, food enzymes and food flavourings]. To allow a suitable transition period, the provisions in Annex III, other than the provisions concerning carriers for food additives and food additives in flavourings, should not apply until 1 January 2011. Until the future Community lists of food additives are established, it is necessary to provide for a simplified procedure allowing the current lists of food additives contained in the existing Directives to be updated. Without prejudice to the outcome of the review referred to in recital 25, within one year following the adoption of this Regulation the Commission should set up an evaluation programme for the Authority to re-evaluate the safety of the food additives that were already approved in the Community. That programme should define the needs and the order of priorities according to which the approved food additives are to be examined. This Regulation repeals and replaces the following acts: Council Directive of 23 October 1962 on the approximation of the rules of the Member States concerning the colouring matters authorised for use in foodstuffs intended for human consumption\\xa0( 17 ), Council Directive 65/66/EEC of 26 January 1965 laying down specific criteria of purity for preservatives authorised for use in foodstuffs intended for human consumption\\xa0( 18 ), Council Directive 78/663/EEC of 25 July 1978 laying down specific criteria of purity for emulsifiers, stabilizers, thickeners and gelling agents for use in foodstuffs\\xa0( 19 ), Council Directive 78/664/EEC of 25 July 1978 laying down specific criteria of purity for antioxidants which may be used in foodstuffs intended for human consumption\\xa0( 20 ), First Commission Directive 81/712/EEC of 28 July 1981 laying down Community methods of analysis for verifying that certain additives used in foodstuffs satisfy criteria of purity\\xa0( 21 ), Council Directive 89/107/EEC of 21 December 1988 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States concerning food additives authorised for use in foodstuffs intended for human consumption\\xa0( 22 ), Directive 94/35/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 June 1994 on sweeteners for use in foodstuffs\\xa0( 23 ), Directive 94/36/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 June 1994 on colours for use in foodstuffs\\xa0( 24 ), Directive 95/2/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 February 1995 on food additives other than colours and sweeteners\\xa0( 25 ), Decision No 292/97/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 December 1996 on the maintenance of national laws prohibiting the use of certain additives in the production of certain specific foodstuffs\\xa0( 26 ) and Commission Decision 2002/247/EC of 27 March 2002 suspending the placing on the market and import of jelly confectionary containing the food additive E 425 konjac\\xa0( 27 ). However, it is appropriate that certain provisions of those acts remain in force during a transitional period to allow time for the preparation of the Community lists in the Annexes to this Regulation, This Regulation lays down rules on food additives used in foods with a view to ensuring the effective functioning of the internal market whilst ensuring a high level of protection of human health and a high level of consumer protection, including the protection of consumer interests and fair practices in food trade, taking into account, where appropriate, the protection of the environment.

COMMUNITY LISTS OF APPROVED FOOD ADDITIVES Community lists of food additives 1.\\xa0\\xa0Only food additives included in the Community list in Annex II may be placed on the market as such and used in foods under the conditions of use specified therein. 2.\\xa0\\xa0Only food additives included in the Community list in Annex III may be used in food additives, in food enzymes and in food flavourings under the conditions of use specified therein. 3.\\xa0\\xa0Food additives in Annex II shall be listed on the basis of the categories of food to which they may be added. 4.\\xa0\\xa0Food additives in Annex III shall be listed on the basis of the food additives, food enzymes, food flavourings and nutrients or categories thereof to which they may be added. 5.\\xa0\\xa0Food additives shall comply with the specifications as referred to in Article 14. No person shall place on the market a food additive or any food in which such a food additive is present if the use of the food additive does not comply with this Regulation. General conditions for inclusion and use of food additives in Community lists 1.\\xa0\\xa0A food additive may be included in the Community lists in Annexes II and III only if it meets the following conditions and, where relevant, other legitimate factors, including environmental factors: (a)\\xa0it does not, on the basis of the scientific evidence available, pose a safety concern to the health of the consumer at the level of use proposed; 2.\\xa0\\xa0To be included in the Community lists in Annexes II and III a food additive must have advantages and benefits for the consumer and therefore serve one or more of the following purposes: (b)\\xa0providing necessary ingredients or constituents for foods manufactured for groups of consumers with special dietary needs; (c)\\xa0enhancing the keeping quality or stability of a food or improving its organoleptic properties, provided that the nature, substance or quality of the food is not changed in such a way as to mislead the consumer; (d)\\xa0aiding in the manufacture, processing, preparation, treatment, packing, transport or storage of food, including food additives, food enzymes and food flavourings, provided that the food additive is not used to disguise the effects of the use of faulty raw materials or of any undesirable practices or techniques, including unhygienic practices or techniques, during the course of any such activities. 3.\\xa0\\xa0By way of derogation from paragraph 2(a), a food additive which reduces the nutritional quality of a food may be included in the Community list in Annex II provided that: (b)\\xa0the food additive is necessary for the production of foods for groups of consumers with special dietary needs. A food additive may be included in the Community list in Annex II for the functional class of sweetener only if, in addition to serving one or more of the purposes set out in Article 6(2), it serves one or more of the following purposes: (a)\\xa0replacing sugars for the production of energy-reduced food, non-cariogenic food or food with no added sugars; or (b)\\xa0replacing sugars where this permits an increase in the shelf-life of the food; or (c)\\xa0producing food intended for particular nutritional uses as defined in Article 1(2)(a) of Directive 89/398/EEC. A food additive may be included in the Community list in Annex II for the functional class of colour only if, in addition to serving one or more of the purposes set out in Article 6(2), it serves one of the following purposes: (a)\\xa0restoring the original appearance of food of which the colour has been affected by processing, storage, packaging and distribution, whereby visual acceptability may have been impaired; Functional classes of food additives Allocating a food additive to a functional class shall not preclude it from being used for several functions. 2.\\xa0\\xa0Where necessary, as a result of scientific progress or technological development, the measures, designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation, relating to additional functional classes which may be added to Annex I shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 28(3). The content of the Community lists of food additives 1.\\xa0\\xa0A food additive which complies with the conditions set out in Articles 6, 7 and 8 may, in accordance with the procedure referred to in Regulation (EC) No 1331/2008 [establishing a common authorisation procedure for food additives, food enzymes and food flavourings] be included in: (a)\\xa0the Community list in Annex II to this Regulation; and/or (b)\\xa0the Community list in Annex III to this Regulation. 2.\\xa0\\xa0The entry for a food additive in the Community lists in Annexes II and III shall specify: (d)\\xa0if appropriate, whether there are any restrictions on the sale of the food additive directly to the final consumer. 3.\\xa0\\xa0The Community lists in Annexes II and III shall be amended in accordance with the procedure referred to in Regulation (EC) No 1331/2008 [establishing a common authorisation procedure for food additives, food enzymes and food flavourings]. Levels of use of food additives (a)\\xa0the level of use shall be set at the lowest level necessary to achieve the desired effect; (i)\\xa0any acceptable daily intake, or equivalent assessment, established for the food additive and the probable daily intake of it from all sources; 2.\\xa0\\xa0Where appropriate, no maximum numerical level shall be fixed for a food additive (quantum satis). In that case, the food additive shall be used in accordance with the principle of quantum satis. 3.\\xa0\\xa0The maximum levels of food additives set out in Annex II shall apply to the food as marketed, unless otherwise stated. By way of derogation from this principle, for dried and/or concentrated foods which need to be reconstituted the maximum levels shall apply to the food as reconstituted according to the instructions on the label taking into account the minimum dilution factor. 4.\\xa0\\xa0The maximum levels for colours set out in Annex II shall apply to the quantities of colouring principle contained in the colouring preparation unless otherwise stated. Changes in the production process or starting materials of a food additive already included in a Community list When a food additive is already included in a Community list and there is a significant change in its production methods or in the starting materials used, or there is a change in particle size, for example through nanotechnology, the food additive prepared by those new methods or materials shall be considered as a different additive and a new entry in the Community lists or a change in the specifications shall be required before it can be placed on the market. Food additives falling within the scope of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 1.\\xa0\\xa0A food additive falling within the scope of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 may be included in the Community lists in Annexes II and III in accordance with this Regulation only when it is covered by an authorisation in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003. 2.\\xa0\\xa0When a food additive already included in the Community list is produced from a different source falling within the scope of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003, it will not require a new authorisation under this Regulation, as long as the new source is covered by an authorisation in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 and the food additive complies with the specifications established under this Regulation. Specifications of food additives The specifications of food additives relating, in particular, to origin, purity criteria and any other necessary information, shall be adopted when the food additive is included in the Community lists in Annexes II and III for the first time, in accordance with the procedure referred to in Regulation (EC) No 1331/2008 [establishing a common authorisation procedure for food additives, food enzymes and food flavourings]. USE OF FOOD ADDITIVES IN FOODS Use of food additives in unprocessed foods Food additives shall not be used in unprocessed foods, except where such use is specifically provided for in Annex II. Use of food additives in foods for infants and young children Food additives shall not be used in foods for infants and young children as referred to in Directive 89/398/EEC, including dietary foods for infants and young children for special medical purposes, except where specifically provided for in Annex II to this Regulation. Only food colours listed in Annex II to this Regulation may be used for the purpose of health marking as provided for in Council Directive 91/497/EEC of 29 July 1991 amending and consolidating Directive 64/433/EEC on health problems affecting intra-Community trade in fresh meat to extend it to the production and marketing of fresh meat\\xa0( 30 ) and other markings required on meat products, for the decorative colouring of eggshells and for the stamping of eggshells as provided for in Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 laying down specific hygiene rules for food of animal origin\\xa0( 31 ). 1.\\xa0\\xa0The presence of a food additive shall be permitted: (a)\\xa0in a compound food other than as referred to in Annex II, where the food additive is permitted in one of the ingredients of the compound food; (b)\\xa0in a food to which a food additive, food enzyme or food flavouring has been added, where the food additive: (i)\\xa0is permitted in the food additive, food enzyme or food flavouring in accordance with this Regulation; and (ii)\\xa0has been carried over to the food via the food additive, food enzyme or food flavouring; and (iii)\\xa0has no technological function in the final food; (c)\\xa0in a food which is to be used solely in the preparation of a compound food and provided that the compound food complies with this Regulation. 2.\\xa0\\xa0Paragraph 1 shall not apply to infant formulae, follow-on formulae, processed cereal-based foods and baby foods and dietary foods for special medical purposes intended for infants and young children as referred to in Directive 89/398/EEC, except where specifically provided for. 3.\\xa0\\xa0Where a food additive in a food flavouring, food additive or food enzyme is added to a food and has a technological function in that food, it shall be considered a food additive of that food and not a food additive of the added flavouring, food additive or food enzyme, and must then comply with the conditions of use for that food as provided for. 4.\\xa0\\xa0Without prejudice to paragraph 1, the presence of a food additive used as a sweetener shall be permitted in a compound food with no added sugars, in an energy-reduced compound food, in compound dietary foods intended for low-calorie diets, in non-cariogenic compound foods, and in a compound food with an increased shelf-life, provided that the sweetener is permitted in one of the ingredients of the compound food. (a)\\xa0a particular food belongs to a category of food referred to in Annex II; or (b)\\xa0a food additive listed in Annexes II and III and permitted at ‘quantum satis’ is used in accordance with the criteria referred to in Article 11(2); or (c)\\xa0a given substance meets the definition of food additive in Article 3. The Member States listed in Annex IV may continue to prohibit the use of certain categories of food additives in the traditional foods produced on their territory as listed in that Annex. 1.\\xa0\\xa0Food additives not intended for sale to the final consumer, whether sold singly or mixed with each other and/or with food ingredients, as defined in Article 6(4) of Directive 2000/13/EC, may only be marketed with the labelling provided for in Article 22 of this Regulation, which must be easily visible, clearly legible and indelible. 2.\\xa0\\xa0Within its own territory, the Member State in which the product is marketed may, in accordance with the Treaty, stipulate that the information provided for in Article 22 shall be given in one or more of the official languages of the Community, to be determined by that Member State. General labelling requirements for food additives not intended for sale to the final consumer 1.\\xa0\\xa0Where food additives not intended for sale to the final consumer are sold singly or mixed with each other and/or other food ingredients and/or with other substances added to them, their packaging or containers shall bear the following information: (e)\\xa0instructions for use, if the omission thereof would preclude appropriate use of the food additive; (g)\\xa0an indication of the maximum quantity of each component or group of components subject to quantitative limitation in food and/or appropriate information in clear and easily understandable terms enabling the purchaser to comply with this Regulation or other relevant Community law; where the same limit on quantity applies to a group of components used singly or in combination, the combined percentage may be given as a single figure; the limit on quantity shall be expressed either numerically or by the quantum satis principle; (j)\\xa0where relevant, information on a food additive or other substances referred to in this Article and listed in Annex IIIa to Directive 2000/13/EC as regards the indication of the ingredients present in foodstuffs. 2.\\xa0\\xa0Where food additives are sold mixed with each other and/or with other food ingredients, their packaging or containers shall bear a list of all ingredients in descending order of their percentage by weight of the total. 3.\\xa0\\xa0Where substances (including food additives or other food ingredients) are added to food additives to facilitate their storage, sale, standardisation, dilution or dissolution, their packaging or containers shall bear a list of all such substances in descending order of their percentage by weight of the total. 4.\\xa0\\xa0By way of derogation from paragraphs 1, 2 and 3, the information required in paragraph 1 points (e) to (g) and in paragraphs 2 and 3 may appear merely on the documents relating to the consignment which are to be supplied with or prior to the delivery, provided that the indication ‘not for retail sale’ appears on an easily visible part of the packaging or container of the product in question. 5.\\xa0\\xa0By way of derogation from paragraphs 1, 2 and 3, where food additives are supplied in tankers, all of the information may appear merely on the accompanying documents relating to the consignment which are to be supplied with the delivery.
